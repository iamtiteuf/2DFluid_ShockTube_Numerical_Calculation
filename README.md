In a 2D simulation of shock tube dynamics aimed at showing pressure, velocity, and temperature profiles, the primary goal is to visualize how these critical parameters evolve over time and space within the tube following the initiation of a shock wave. This simulation would serve as a valuable tool for researchers and students to understand the complex interactions and transformations occurring within the shock wave front and the affected regions.

Pressure, velocity, and temperature are fundamental variables in fluid dynamics and play pivotal roles in determining the behavior of gases under various conditions. In the context of a shock tube, these variables are expected to undergo significant changes as the shock wave propagates through the gas, compressing and heating it.

- **Pressure Profiles**: Initially, the pressure is uniform throughout the tube. Upon the arrival of the shock wave, the pressure suddenly increases, leading to a steep gradient in the pressure profile. This increase in pressure is responsible for the rapid compression of the gas.

- **Velocity Profiles**: The velocity of the gas changes dramatically upon being hit by the shock wave. Just behind the shock wave, the gas experiences a sudden increase in velocity, which then gradually decreases as the shock wave spreads out and the gas returns to a more quiescent state.

- **Temperature Profiles**: Similar to pressure and velocity, the temperature of the gas also undergoes a sharp rise just behind the shock wave due to the intense compression and heating caused by the shock. As the shock wave dissipates, the temperature begins to decrease, returning towards its initial value.

Using C++, GLFW for window management and input handling, and ImGui for rendering the graphical user interface, the simulation would allow users to interactively explore these profiles. Adjustments to simulation parameters, such as the initial pressures of the driver and driven gases, the properties of the diaphragm, and the dimensions of the tube, could be made in real-time, providing immediate feedback on how these changes impact the pressure, velocity, and temperature profiles within the shock tube. This interactive approach facilitates a deeper understanding of the underlying physics and offers a practical means to test hypotheses and validate theoretical predictions.
